      <h1>What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? <br/> How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term? </h1>
      <p>I am not sure what would be the most common issue customers face. I would assume it would be handling build issues.</p>
      <p>To answer the second part of this question there are a few ways I would suggest to help cusomters.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a library of documentation, blog articles, and other learning outlets for customers to find answers to their questions or issues.</li>
        <li>Improve the details in the error messages customers are seeing. </li>
        <li>Provide training and education events to help customers stay informed on common product issues, or updates on product releases/updates.</li>
      </ul>
