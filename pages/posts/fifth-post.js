     <p>Hi &lt;customer name&gt;,</p>

      My name is Armani and I am a technical support engineer at Vercel.

      <p>I see you for several hours you have been seeing the following error when trying to deploy your application &quot;/vercel/path0/dist/routes-manifest.json could not be found.&quot; I imagine this is very frustrating so I would like to help you solve this issue.</p>

      <p>I have a few questions for you</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>I understand this may need to be resolved qucikly since you have already spent hours troubleshooting this issue. To speed things up, I have some time this afternoon or tomorrow morning if you would like to get on a call/screenshare to discuss this issue further.</p>

      <p>Regards,<br/>
      Armani Appolon</p>

      <hr/>

      <p>I am not sure what this error message is for? I am assuming this customer is missing a file in her repo/project.</p>

      <p>I would look for documentation that would provide this customer with the steps to fix this issue. But more importantly look for docs that would provide information on how to prevent this issue from happening again. I would look for articles/docs that could educate this customers on why this type of error occured and understand what the error message is saying. I believe it benefits the customer to educate them while helping them with issues. This empowers the user in my opinion and I hope gives them more confidence in the product I am supporting.</p>
